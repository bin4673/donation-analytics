Summary

There are four processes:

    median(): use to find the median of an array.
    zipfun(): use to process the data as required by output "medianvals_by_zip.txt" file.
    datefun(): use to process the data as required by output "medianvals_by_date.txt" file.
    wout(): export the results to correspoding output file.

The data is read as a whole and processed by zipfun()/datefun(), and finally exported by wout().
Tests

General large input/output are in the correponding directories.

The test is passed by running:
